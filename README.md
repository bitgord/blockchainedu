Globally Accessible Prediction Markets
Uses wisdom of the crowd to predict future events and provide information about the real world. 
Can be used to predict presidential elections, the weather, if a scientific breakthrough might occur, etc by letting people bet on their guesses.
Creates a public database of information about the real world, enabling programs to create “if/then” statements on real life events without needing to trust a 3-rd party. 
Gives startups and small companies access to wide market data to make better predictions and reduces risk of failure. Makes information more accessible to small/medium sized businesses that is normally only priced for larger businesses to acquire and keep for themselves. 

Indentity & IoT Security 
Controlling identity allows for reputation to be used across services, better control of your private information which gives individuals more leverage over advertisers, requiring incentive or payment to see their data. 
Enables more sharing economy business models to take hold, because you don’t need to resolve the stranger danger when you can use your reputation from other online activities.
Enables security for the internet of things by enabling secure payments and messages between all your devices. The more we enable internet of things, we need proper security to prevent our reliance on these technologies from turning against us. 
Imagine this scenario, all your devices are connected to the internet. Even your washer automatically purchases detergent when it’s levels get low. Imagine if a hacker was able to get into all these washers and have them buy slightly more detergent than they usually require, increasing demand for detergent. This hacker could create longs on detergent futures and through weak security hack into a bunch of washers to spike demand. IoT requires devices to be constantly communicating with each other, blockchained identity provides a flexible authentication layer to prevent malicious tampering. 
This combined security and mobility enables your information to be wherever you are without compromise or vulnerability. 
Internet of things needs a ledger of things - objects can communicate with eachother and send a signal when they need repair
Down to each piece of meat can have a sensor - when there is a problem with mad cow people know exactly which meat to take off the shelf

Rebuilding Government
Voting on the Blockchain, easily secures one vote per identity
Transparency in finances for humanitarian aid and auditing government use of funds
Enables automatic taxing on economic activities that go directly to government wallets (which is transparent and publicly auditable). Funds can be directed and voted upon locally, and taxes can be reduced when there is less avoidance. 
Open and immutable records, keeps government accountable and laws/case law available easily.
Government tools built and used in America can be used anywhere across the world who are inspired to recreate similar programs. 

Rebuilding Culture
Music & Art: redefining authorship and direct payments without middlemen
Uncensorable publishing: timestamped documents prevent tampering of information published
Self-Empowerment: anyone in the world has complete access to the financial tools and services required to start and grow a global business. This is empowering to small/medium-size businesses by providing access to tools normally restricted to larger businesses.
Marketing: increased control of identity restricts mass advertising, further requiring a more narrow approach. Modern marketing is much more targeted than mass TV advertising practices of the past, and this trend is going to be further accelerated when individuals have more leverage and control of their information.
